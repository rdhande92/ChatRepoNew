To correct this, we can add `response_count` to the `GROUP BY` clause of the `company_responses` subquery.  However, this will cause an error in the final `SELECT` statement, since `response_count` is not a valid column to group by. To fix this, we can create a new subquery called `response_count` that groups by `company`, `company_response_to_consumer`, and `year`, and sums up the `response_count` column. We can then use this subquery in the final `SELECT` statement instead of `company_responses`."
